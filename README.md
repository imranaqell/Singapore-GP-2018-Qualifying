# Hamilton's hair rising lap at the 2018 Singapore GP Qualifying

**Introduction**

It was very tight in 2018 with Sebastian Vettel with his infamous machinery, the Ferrari SF71H, against Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes W09. In round 15, Formula 1 raced in Singapore, one of the most challenging circuit on the calendar for its' tight corners and also the weather, which is very high and intense humidity. On the 15th of September that year, Lewis Hamilton put in a lap which was so dominant that his nearest rival was only Max Verstappen, who was 3 tenths down. The lap was so intense that it even beat the Mercedes supercomputer simulation of lap time.

**Summary**

From the visualization made, it proves that Lewis Hamilton was definitely on the limit. It was definitely amazing how he was pushing the car while fighting all those intense G-forces and the weather of the country of Singapore. In most corners, he was able to go significantly faster than Max Verstappen, which gained him lots of time. The Mercedes W09's acceleration was something to be afraid of.

In the Ford VS Ferrari movie, there is one line that perfectly defines the lap that was executed by Lewis Hamilton, which is by Ken Miles, who said, "If you're going to push a piece of machinery to the limit and expect it to hold together, you have to have some sense of where that limit is. Look out there. Out there is the perfect lap. No mistakes."
